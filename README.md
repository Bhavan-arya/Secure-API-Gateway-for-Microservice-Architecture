# Secure API Gateway for Microservice Architecture

This repository is intended to serve as a starting point for building a secure API Gateway with a microservices architecture.

## Project Structure

```
API-Gateway-with-Microservices/
├── gateway/
│   └── src/
├── my-frontend/
│   └── node_modules/
└── services/
    └── user_service/
        └── src/
```

### Folders:
- **gateway/**: Intended for the API Gateway service. This is where the main gateway logic, authentication, rate limiting, and telemetry would be implemented.
- **services/user_service/**: Placeholder for a user microservice. Additional microservices can be added under the `services/` directory.
- **my-frontend/**: Placeholder for a frontend application. Currently only contains `node_modules/`.

## Current Status
- The repository currently contains only the folder structure and a `.gitignore` file.
- No actual source code or configuration files are present yet.
- The `.gitignore` is set up to exclude system files, Python cache, and node modules.

## Next Steps
1. **Implement the API Gateway**
   - Add source code to `gateway/src/` for routing, authentication, rate limiting, and telemetry.
2. **Develop Microservices**
   - Add code for user and other microservices under `services/`.
3. **Frontend Development**
   - Add frontend source code to `my-frontend/`.
4. **Add Documentation**
   - Expand this README with setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and usage examples as the project develops.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by adding code, documentation, or suggestions.
